# Clustering estrogen receptor positive breast cancer tumors based on hormonal response type

Project in Machine Learning (CS-433)

EPFL, 2019

## Abstract
We employ unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster subtypes of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which is the most common variant worldwide. Clustering is done according to hormone responses obtained from *in vivo* models of patient-derived xenografts. Our results facilitate more targeted treatment of patients, responding to the urgent need for personalized medicine to treat breast cancer.
